### Highlight

#### Tooltips Rework

In this update we reworked tooltips.
Now they give you more info than ever, 
and they also give you info in better ways!

Take a look at this loaded AK-47 with attachments, modifications and a skin:

AK-47 Before:

<img src="https://github.com/Cubed-Development/Modern-Warfare-Cubed/assets/82710983/ba5ab893-44e3-47ce-8df3-04b079dc7b3f" alt="Before" width="256">

AK-47 After:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/808851a8-2b08-47f1-9c0b-73a3ec9013c4" alt="After" width="364">

This was just an example, 
but we reworked every tooltip.
Some things in the mod did not have custom tooltips at all, so we changed that, check it out:

Attachments New Tooltips:

<img src="https://github.com/Cubed-Development/Modern-Warfare-Cubed/assets/82710983/6ad9be3f-99ac-48ab-aa7d-6a165ab1260f" alt="Before" width="256">

Melee Weapons New Tooltips:

This should really help in a lot of situations,
like knowing which weapon is better or whether an attachment will be useful to you.
