<h3 align="center">What is this MWC?</h3>

This mod introduces a plethora of new features to Minecraft, including an extensive arsenal of modern weaponry, new explosives, vehicles, and more.

It introduces a wide range of modern weapons to Minecraft, including assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, pistols, and more. These weapons are modeled after real-life firearms and come complete with authentic sound effects and animations.

<br><br>

<h3 align="center">Gun Customization & Statistics</h3>

Our weaponry is heavily customizable with a highly advanced attachment system made up of 3 main parts; **Customization**, **Modification** and **Attachments**.

Each weapon has its own unique attributes, such as rate of fire, accuracy, and damage. Some weapons have specialized attachments that can be added, like scopes, suppressors, and more, to further enhance their performance.
