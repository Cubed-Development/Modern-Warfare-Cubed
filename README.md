Massive shoutout to the author of [Vic's Modern Warfare Mod](https://github.com/vic4games/modern-warfare): [Vic4Games](https://github.com/vic4games) and the rest of his team for the original mod, and some of the textures / models / other assets that have been utilized from their mod.

Another massive thank you to all of the contributors, and members of the development team. We wouldn't be where we are now without the support from you all!
