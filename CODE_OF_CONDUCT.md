# Ragnar√∂k Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our projects a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone.

- **Sharing ideas:** Our projects thrives on new ideas. We encourage all members of our community to share their ideas and suggestions, as they often lead to more and better ideas.
- **No politics:** We believe that our projects is not the place for political discussions or debates. Our focus should always be on improving our projects.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following types of behavior are considered unacceptable within our projects:

- Harassment, including any unwelcome attention, contact, or comments.
- Discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks, verbal abuse, or derogatory comments.
- Trolling, sustained disruption, or posting inflammatory or derogatory messages with the intent of causing disruption.
- Publication of private communications or personal information without consent.

## Enforcement

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, project maintainers will take appropriate action. This may include issuing a warning, temporarily banning the participant from the project, or, in extreme cases, permanently banning the participant. We believe in giving people second chances, and we will usually issue a warning before taking more drastic measures.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Contact

If you have any questions or need to report a violation of this Code of Conduct, please contact the project maintainers.

We strongly encourage every member of our community to contribute to this evolution. Feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism about our Code of Conduct are always welcome. Your perspective can help us to maintain an environment that respects and values all participants.
