Before making any changes, create a new branch. This will help you keep your changes separate from the main codebase and make it easier to collaborate with other contributors. To create a new branch, click on the branch selector in the top-left corner of GitHub Desktop, then click "New branch" and give your branch a descriptive name.

Make your changes in IntelliJ IDEA. When you're done, save your changes and commit them to your branch in GitHub Desktop. Be sure to write a clear and descriptive commit message that explains the changes you made.

When you're ready to share your changes with the project, create a pull request. To do this, go to the [main GitHub page of MWC] and click the "Pull requests" tab. Then click the green "New pull request" button.

Select the branch that contains your changes and the branch that you want to merge your changes into. This is usually the main branch of the repository.

Write a clear and descriptive title for your pull request. In the description, explain the changes you made and why you made them. Be sure to mention any related issues or pull requests that your changes address.

Review your changes and make sure everything looks good. Then click the green "Create pull request" button.

Wait for your pull request to be reviewed by other contributors. You may need to make some changes based on their feedback. Once your pull request is approved, your changes will be merged into the main codebase.
